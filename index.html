    <!-- Our approach -->

        <div class="right-cont">
            <h2><u>Our approach</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li> We completely transformed the way in which learning is imparted to students. <br>
                Unlike traditional chalk and board method of teaching, eLearning makes learning <br>
                simpler, easier, and more effective.</li><br>
            <li>E-Learning is the process of using technology to assist learning and tutoring.<br>
                Enhancement in how the Internet works has allowed websites to deliver a visual<br>
                and immersive learning experience on a computer or mobile device, perfect <br>
                for stimulating a student and encouraging learning.</li><br>
            <li>We provide cost effective as compared to traditional forms of learning. <br>
                The reason for this price reduction is because learning through this mode <br>
                happens quickly and easily. A lot of training time is reduced with respect <br>
                to trainers, travel, course materials, and accommodation.</li> <br>
            <li> As eLearning is a paperless way of learning, it protects the environment to a lot <br>
                of extent. As per a study done on eLearning courses, it has been found that <br>
                distance-based learning programs consumed around 90% less power and generated <br>
                85% less amount of CO2 emissions as compared to traditional campus-based <br>
                educational courses. With eLearning, there is no need to cut trees for
                obtaining paper. <br> eLearning is a highly eco-friendly way of learning.</li>

            <h2><u>Our Process</u></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We offer technologies the most efficient way for students and businesses <br>
                    to improve skills and track performance or scores. </li><br>
                <li>E-learning platforms gradually change an eternal issue with the documentation - <br>
                    all the information on courses, training programs, and students' data is centralized <br>
                    and safely stored in an online database. No need to visit libraries - you simply <br>
                    download the necessary course, and - itâ€™s done!</li><br>

                <li> E-Learning materials are accessible at any time from any place, meaning learning <br>
                    can fit around your existing daily schedule and eliminate any travel costs associated <br>
                    with classroom based training.</li><br>
                <li>We enables you to quickly create and communicate new policies, training, ideas,<br>
                    and concepts. Online E-Learning sessions are especially easy to keep up-to-date because <br>
                    the updated materials are simply uploaded to a server and can be managed from anywhere <br>
                    using a bespoke admin system created to your specific requirements.</li>
